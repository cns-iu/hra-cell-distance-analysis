# Cell Distance Analysis for Spatial Omics Datasets


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

> The notebooks are designed to process and analyze the distances
> between cells in spatial omics datasets, with a particular focus on
> endothelial cells. They calculate the distances between all pairs of
> cells and visualize the distribution of these distances. The notebooks
> also include functionality to filter the data based on specific cell
> types and to visualize the results using histograms, violin plots, and
> other visualizations.

## For Developers

The repository uses `quarto` for documentation and `nbdev` for notebook
processing.

To update the README file from the `nbs/index.ipynb` notebook, run the
following command in the root directory of the repository:

    nbdev_readme

Then, to save the notebooks and render them using the `nbdev` library,
you can run the following command in the root directory of the
repository:

    rm -rf _proc && nbdev_proc_nbs && cd _proc && quarto publish gh-pages --no-prompt

Then, push to GitHub:

    git add .
    git commit -m 'Updated repo' # Update this text with your own message
    git push

The rendered and deployed notebooks will be available via GitHub Pages
at the following URL:
