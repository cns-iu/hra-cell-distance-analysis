# Cell Distance Analysis for Spatial Omics Datasets


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

> The notebooks are designed to process and analyze the distances
> between cells in spatial omics datasets, with a particular focus on
> endothelial cells. They calculate the distances between all pairs of
> cells and visualize the distribution of these distances. The notebooks
> also include functionality to filter the data based on specific cell
> types and to visualize the results using histograms, violin plots, and
> other visualizations.

## Preprint

Preprint of the paper describing the work is available on bioRxiv

## Data Availability

All datasets (cell coordinates and cell types) used in the paper,
original and processed (including harmonized cell type labels), are made
publicly available

## Code Availability

All code for data processing and analysis for distance analysis is
available on GitHub
(<https://github.com/cns-iu/hra-cell-distance-analysis>).

Rendered Jupyter notebooks for the entire workflow are also available on
GitHub Pages (<https://cns-iu.github.io/hra-cell-distance-analysis>).

The file containing all cell types, original and 3-level typology,
mapped to Cell Ontology, is available as a CSV file on GitHub
(<https://github.com/cns-iu/hra-cell-distance-analysis/blob/main/data/mapping_files/generated_cell_type_complete_crosswalk.csv>).

Code for hierarchical neighborhood analysis is available on GitHub
(<https://github.com/HickeyLab/Vasculature_neighborhoods>).

The Cell Distance Explorer application is available on the Human
Reference Atlas website (<https://apps.humanatlas.io/cde>).

More information, including usage tutorial, about the CDE can be found
at (<https://humanatlas.io/user-story/5>).

The python package for CDE can be found as part of HRA Jupyter Widgets
(<https://github.com/x-atlas-consortia/hra-jupyter-widgets/>).

Documentation to embed the CDE in webpages as a lightweight component is
available at
(<https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/hra-ui/blob/main/apps/cde-visualization-wc/EMBEDDING.md>).

## For Developers

The repository uses [`quarto`](https://quarto.org/) for documentation
and [`nbdev`](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) for notebook processing.

To update the README file from the `nbs/index.ipynb` notebook, run the
following command in the root directory of the repository:

    nbdev_readme

Then, to save the notebooks and render them using the `nbdev` library,
you can run the following command in the root directory of the
repository:

    rm -rf _proc && nbdev_proc_nbs && cd _proc && quarto publish gh-pages --no-prompt

Then, push to GitHub:

    git add .
    git commit -m 'Updated repo' # Update this text with your own message
    git push

The rendered and deployed notebooks will be available via GitHub Pages
at the following URL:

<https://cns-iu.github.io/hra-cell-distance-analysis>
